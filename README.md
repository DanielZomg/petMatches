# petMatches

## To do list:
1. add gender;
2. deal with possibility bold attributes don't match bloodline-required ones: just have all 6 attributes as input(?);
3. on the search pets page, selecting species should restrict choices for breeds;
4. make a few more things dynamic(?): usernames, list of events, list of attributes per event.
